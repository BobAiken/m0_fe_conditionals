1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent quite some time, but i stopped to get lunch and fix mistakes in a previous assignment. I didn't estimate time from the beginning but I did find this lesson very long. I need to work on typing faster while looking at the screen. The comparisons.js lessons took awhile because of all the prompts to read and type answers to.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Nothing specific to the concepts I need to practice. Typing speed will improve over time considering I'm going to be doing a lot of it over the coming months.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
None related to the material found within this lesson. I could always ask my small group for help if need be.
